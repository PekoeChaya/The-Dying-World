You have reached the extra-temporal help line. Please state your concern at the tone, and the matter will be addressed retroactively.&quot;

That is my voicemail greeting; it was initially recorded as a joke, but when you run in the kinds of circles I do you end up getting a lot of calls requiring that sort of help. So, I left it up ironically, the way young people these days might wear shirts that say &#x27;tech support&#x27; when they go to visit their parents. Since I only ever gave that number to friends, there was no reason to expect that anyone would take it seriously.

Then, of course, someone did.

[[Next-&gt;1]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="1" tags="intro" position="502,170">One nice thing about this line of work is that I don&#x27;t get a lot of phone calls. Even telemarketers can&#x27;t reach this number, on account of the fact that I am not connected to any standard phone network. At some point, some brilliant individual (who was not me) saw a need for trans-dimensional cellular service and filled it; then, some colleagues and I expanded on the protocol. The technical details are unimportant, but the end result is that I know exactly where and when a call is coming from.

The downside is that every phone call is an unexpected rarity, and receiving one from an unknown number is cause for concern. Imagine receiving a call with no name attached and from an area code you don&#x27;t even recognize, but in my case it was from a timeline I had never even heard of and a year no one I knew should be in. That was the sort of confusion and panic I experienced as my phone rang quite unexpectedly one day and I just stood there and stared at it until it went to voicemail.

What else was I supposed to do?

Admittedly, my first assumption was that someone had made some grave error</tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>
