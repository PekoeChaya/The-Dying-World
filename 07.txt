"What do you suppose that's about?"

Maria shrugged in response. "I only met him like five minutes ago. My friend said he was some kind of oracle, so I asked him..."

She hesitated, suddenly realizing that the subject matter was too heavy to just throw about casually. She glanced to her white-plumed conversation partner, but his expression was one of simple curiosity.

"I asked him what will happen to this world," she finished, in a quieter tone. The man looked down and gave a half-hearted chuckle.

"You don't need an oracle for that, child." He continued walking out towards the hallway at a somber pace. "This world will die - or it will find another monarch and be reborn."

He paused on the threshold and half-whispered, "I can't decide which is worse."

"Why...?" Maria's voice seemed to catch. The caretaker glanced over his shoulder at her and flashed a brief, sad smile before looking back down.

"There's no reason to keep it a secret any longer," he said, as though to himself. "It probably shouldn't have been one to begin with."

Looking back up to Maria, he held out a delicate and pale-skinned hand, the arm to which it was attached covered in vestigial flight feathers as white as bleached bone.

"Walk with me?" he offered. "I shall show you the atrium; it's the only beautiful thing left in this world."
